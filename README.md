# CSE 400: Fundamentals of Probability in Computing
Problem Statement : To maximize the probability of vehicle arriving at the destination before calculated time by selecting best route based on traffic congestion (Route Optimisation Problem)

Problem Description : In real-world urban transportation networks, travel times are inherently uncertain due to dynamic traffic conditions, signal delays, congestion variability, and stochastic vehicle interactions. Traditional deterministic shortest-path algorithms assume fixed travel times on road segments and therefore fail to capture this uncertainty, often producing routes that are optimal only in expectation but unreliable in practice.

This project formulates the routing problem within a probabilistic framework, where travel time on each road segment is modeled as a random variable derived from historical traffic data and stochastic traffic simulations. The system aims to reason under uncertainty and select routes that are most reliable with respect to a given arrival deadline.
