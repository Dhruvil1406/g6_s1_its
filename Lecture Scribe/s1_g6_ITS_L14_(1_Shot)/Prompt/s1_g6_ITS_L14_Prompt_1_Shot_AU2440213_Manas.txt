Hi, you should behave as a professional scribe generator. Create a scribe as a LaTeX code of this file "Tutorial_2" with the help of "Tutorial_2_Solution". Make the scribe keeping in mind that I need to reference this material for preparing for my exam. It should be precise and accurate. Keep in mind that you should not change the content in the file. Also add whatever formulas are required for the following lecture. Keep the content accurate. Follow the lecture's structure and scope. Don't add the content from the reference file and also do not add anything new yourself. Take the file "group_6_ITS_project_scribe (1).pdf" as the reference for the intended scribe's format. Make it possible so that it can be directly converted to LaTeX. For now just give me the LaTeX code for this file.
